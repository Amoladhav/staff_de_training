## Status Meaning
- RED: weak / not interview-ready
- YELLOW: usable but inconsistent
- GREEN: interview-ready
- BLUE: Staff-level confident

## Current Work
- New Git/runtime thread confirmed 2026-10-16: checkpoint 26; previous thread ended at 23; review: finish current Git checkpoint, reassess before new feature; next scheduled review 30. Git state rechecked; PR #1 merge 191dd10 integrated locally; runtime diagnostics next. Learner aggregate shows 3 rows / 3 distinct IDs, matching fixture count; raw preview matches fixture IDs, statuses and amounts; completeness reasoning remains pending.
- Active checkpoint: W08 repository foundation — In Progress, moved ahead of further pipeline changes; W05–W07 remaining acceptance preserved.
- Current work-item statuses, diagrams, developer workflows and evidence: [Dataflow tracker](../docs/DATAFLOW_TRACKER.md). This supersedes older setup-next-step notes below.
- Next action: Commit remaining eight reviewed documentation files using B11 CHANGED CODE. Set PROJECT_ROOT to workspace, BR_NAME=fix/runtime-reproducibility and a documentation COMMIT_MSG. Commit 6a464f2 contains only README; command references/instructions/checkpoint records remain modified. Local feature HEAD matches cached origin feature ref; live remote/PR not queried. Publish follow-up commit afterward.
- Then: bounded failure/recovery, batch completeness contract and source-backed build/test acceptance.
- Azure billing/budget readiness and PowerShell saved variable remain unverified.

### Setup evidence
- WSL copy of all 18 OneDrive source files verified byte-for-byte before documentation updates; original retained.
- Linux Python 3.14.4, venv/ensurepip imports, Linux Git path verified.
- Azure CLI still resolves to Windows; native Linux CLI not verified.
- VS Code `WSL: Ubuntu` indicator confirmed by learner on 2026-10-13.
- Learner verified Linux `.venv`: Python 3.14.4 and pip 25.1.1 both resolve inside the project environment.
- PowerShell saved `$training`, current full source-backed build/test acceptance, Azure upgrade and budget configuration remain pending.
- Other readiness scores above are baseline placeholders, not new competency assessments.

## Revisit Queue
None yet.

## Open Questions
See `05_QUESTION_BACKLOG.md`.

## Evidence of Skill
Track concrete proof:
- code written independently
- timed problems solved
- architecture designs defended
- GitHub artifacts
- certification/labs
- mock-interview performance

### dbt connection checkpoint
- Installed in Linux `.venv`: dbt-core 1.12.0, dbt-duckdb 1.11.0.
- Learner output confirms project/profile validation and local DuckDB connection passed.
- first_orders execution and its unique/not_null data tests verified; completed_orders preview confirmed by learner.
